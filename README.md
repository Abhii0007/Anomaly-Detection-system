The Intrusion Anomaly Detection System (IADS) is a Python-based 
desktop application developed using the Qt Framework (PySide6) 
and Windows APIs. The system monitors suspicious or unauthorized 
activities on your device and alerts users via a Telegram bot using the BotFather API.

Key Features:
Real-time monitoring of network packets using scapy.
System resource monitoring (CPU, memory, etc.) using psutil.
Platform and environment information tracking using platform.
Alert system for suspicious activities via Telegram Bot API.

Python Version: 3.11.0
Framework: Qt (PySide6, version 6.7.1)
OS Compatibility: Windows 10/11
Dependencies:
sys, time, threading, os, csv, requests, socket.
psutil for system monitoring.
scapy for network packet sniffing.
platform for system information.
